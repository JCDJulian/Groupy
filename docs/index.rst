Welcome to Groupy's documentation!
==================================

The simple yet powerful wrapper for the GroupMe API

Introduction
============

GroupMe is a messaging app that allows you to create groups and have others
join them with you. In addition to group messaging, fellow group members can be
messaged directly. GroupMe is available for most platforms, lets you share
links, images, and locations, and messages can be favorited (or "liked"). You
can `read more about GroupMe`_, but the best part about it is that they provide
an API!

.. _read more about GroupMe: http://groupme.com

The GroupMe API is documented, but there are some notable omissions. Many of
the properties of groups and messages are not documented, and some features are
only hinted at by the documentation. Regardless, all of the information about
your groups, their members, their messages, you, and your bots can be obtained
through the GroupMe API. You can `read the API documentation`_ for more (or
less) detailed information.

But **Groupy** lets you forget about the GroupMe API and focus on what you need
to get done!
